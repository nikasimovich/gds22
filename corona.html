<h3><mark>COVID-19/Coronavirus Updates</mark></h3>

<p>For the rest of the semester, our class will continue to meet online.</p>

<p>The class continues to meet on Mondays from 10am to 4pm. We&rsquo;ll start each session with a video check in on <a href="https://meetingsamer3.webex.com/meet/nf294">WebEx</a>. Then we&rsquo;ll have individual meetings through Slack. At the end of the session, we&rsquo;ll have a virtual &ldquo;pin up&rdquo; of our work for the day.</p><p>Please make sure to check the agenda each session for notes and additional information. Our projects will be adjusted to accomodate the tools we have as a class. There will be options for completing each one and we will revise the last two projects â€“ I&rsquo;ll communicate this at the start of each check in. Your camera should be on during our virtual check ins.</p>
