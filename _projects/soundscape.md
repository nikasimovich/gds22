### Overview
Depending on the COVID-19 situation, either visit a museum or review a museum’s online collection. Select one piece of art that stands out to you and research its history and author. Create an audio composition that highlights the artwork. Your audio track could either take an accessibility perspective and describe what the artwork looks like as though it were alt text online, or it could be more narrative focused and describe the experience of viewing the artwork from your perspective.

You’ll also design one 11 x 17 print out to go along with the audio recording. One side of the print out will include a photo of the artwork, and the other will include a transcript of your audio recording.
