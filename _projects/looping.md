### Overview
Select an artwork from [Rhizome’s net art anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) that you like. Imagine that you’re tasked with creating a projection of the artwork for a party. Create three different looping animations that highlight different aspects of the artwork. The last few seconds of the animations should include the title of the work and the artist, and can help systematize the explorations.
