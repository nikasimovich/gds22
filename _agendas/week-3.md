### Homework
- Select your piece of artwork for the Soundscapes activity. Document what it looks like. Write a paragraph that explains who created it, what time period it&rsquo;s from, what art period it is involved with, and a little about the artist. In a second paragraph, describe literally what the artwork looks like. In a third paragraph, describe your interest about the piece and why you&rsquo;re choosing to work with it. Next, begin brainstorming how you might use audio with your piece and create a draft of the transcript.
